# Content-Based-Movie-Recommendation-System
A content-based movie recommendation system in Python suggests movies based on their features and a user's preferences. You'll collect movie data (e.g., genres, plots) and user interaction data (e.g., ratings). Using libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, you'll preprocess the data, calculate similarities between movies, and generate recommendations tailored to the user's interests.
